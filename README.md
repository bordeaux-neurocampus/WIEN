## Resources

### [Installation](lessons/programming/01-installation.md) (If you wish to have Python in your computer)

This lesson aims at providing the student with a clean development environment,
including Python installation and essential packages, a decent text editor, and
a shell. We'll also introduce the Python & IPython shells, the **Jupyter notebook**
and explains how to run a python script from the command line.
In case you cannot install Python/Anaconda in your computer, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb). We've added a short tutorial on how to use Colab in [here](lessons/programming/colab_steps.md).

### [Introduction](lessons/programming/02-introduction.md)

We introduce here Python, a powerful and easy to learn programming language. It
has *efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach
to object-oriented programming* (Python website). However, we'll only
cover the strict minimum necessary for getting started with numerical computing.

<br/>


### [Numerical computing](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html)

This lesson gives an overview of NumPy, the core library for performant
numerical computing, with support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and
matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to
operate on these arrays.

**Prerequisites**: [Introduction](#introduction)  
**See also**: [Numpy for Matlab users](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html),

[Numpy Absolute Beginners](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html)
<br/>


### [Data Visualization](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)

We'll explore the matplotlib library which is a Python 2D plotting library
which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and
interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python
scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application
servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

**Prerequisites**: [Numerical computing](#numerical-computing)

<br/>


### [The Open Science movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) 

Open Science is the movement to make scientific research and data accessible to all. It includes practices such as publishing open scientific research, campaigning for open access and generally making it easier to publish and communicate scientific knowledge. Additionally, it includes other ways to make science more transparent and accessible during the research process. This includes open notebook science, citizen science, and aspects of open source software and crowdfunded research projects. (UNESCO)
