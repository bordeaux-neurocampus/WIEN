## What to prepare in advance:
### [Introduction](lessons/programming/02-introduction.md)

We introduce here Python, a powerful and easy to learn programming language. It
has *efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach
to object-oriented programming* (Python website). However, we'll only
cover the strict minimum necessary for getting started with numerical computing.

**Prerequisites**: [Installation](#installation)  
**See also**: [Official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/tutorial), [Dive into Python](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/),
[Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
